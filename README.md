Steel Modular Clean Cooking Stove Mex01


Prefabricated Clean Wood Burning Cookstove Developed in Mexico 2015-2016.
For small business and comunities, it can reach 250Â°c in 10 Minutes, we adapted the Winarski Rocket Stove Principles
to this solution, culturally adapted to Mexican Food, served with corn tortillas and derivatives.
Also it can boil 5 liters of water in 20 minutes for pasteurization or preparing soups and sauce's.

The excesive and irrational use of wood in open fire for cooking along developing countries, besides the smoke produced in poorly ventilated kitchens were the requeriments to solve with this project.
